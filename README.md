URP 的光照让2D游戏看起来很不错很精致,在调UI和音效的路上越走越远
后续多做几个关卡，难度再增加的话，加一堆小猫咪跟着猫猫侠怎么样？
当然资源暂时来自Unity商城，想法还是自己的！
The lighting of URP makes 2D games look great and exquisite, and it goes further and further in adjusting UI and sound effects
How about doing a few more levels in the future? If the difficulty increases further, how about adding a bunch of kittens and following Cat Man?
Of course, the resources are temporarily sourced from the Unity store, and the ideas are still my own!
